Well, things are not going so well for Konami recently and due to eFootball 2022 blunder, they are still struggling to fix things. But here, Konami has just announced that eFootball 2023 Mobile will be released late August. As things are happening recently, you can expect delays, large-scale maintenance, etc. in the coming days. And all we can do is hope that eFootball 2023 (PES 23) will be better than the current game.
